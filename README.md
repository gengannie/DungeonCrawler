## Dungeon Crawler - turn based

#### What will the application do?  
This is a turn-based card game that features aspects of a dungeon crawler. 
Users can start this world as a hero, and the hero is incentivized to explore the world and attack monsters through
chests and coin piles present in the world. As mentioned previously, this game is turn-based. 
In other words, the hero would have 2 separate actions before the monsters attack.
A key feature of this game is the ability to use special cards on these monsters.

##### Who will use it?
Those who like card-games, board games, DND games, and other RPG games might like this.

##### Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interest to me because I spent a lot of time playing the title "Demeo" on Oculus VR.
I cannot find a similar game on PC, as this game title is only released on virtual reality. 
Thus, I would like to make a PC version of this game.
